This is a C++ program that counts how many times it's been run. It stores the amount in a text file called "output.txt".

Steps:
  1. Declare an ifstream and ofstream.
  2. Declare and initialize (doesn't need to be initialized) the integer variable count.
  3. Open the file with ifstream.
      3.5. If it fails (file doesn't exist), append a one to the file using ofstream.
  4. Take in the count from the file.
  5. Open the ofstream.
  6. Replace the number with the number incremented by one.

Happy April Fool's!
